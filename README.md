This repository contains the projects completed as part of the Airbnb Sydney SQL Crash Course. The course focused on enhancing SQL skills through practical exercises simulating real-world scenarios in managing data for Airbnb Sydney. Below is a summary of the projects completed:# SQLQueryProject
#Week 1: Launching Airbnb Sydney!!

In the first project, I applied foundational SQL concepts learned in the course material to retrieve data directly from a database. Through real-world scenarios, I deepened my understanding of SQL queries, ensuring that all concepts covered aligned with the examples provided in the course material.

#Week 2: Summarize data of Airbnb Sydney!

The second project built upon the knowledge gained in the first week. Here, I focused on aggregating data and exploring advanced SQL intricacies. Using SQL queries, I summarized data relevant to managing Airbnb Sydney, ensuring that I could apply the concepts learned to solve practical challenges faced by the General Manager.
